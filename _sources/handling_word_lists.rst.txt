Handling Word Lists
=========================================================

When it comes to brute-forcing, word lists make the world go 'round. Some people spends days, months, weeks and even years refining their word lists, from most common, to frequently used. These lists are often build by the community for the community, or are a hodge-podge of maybes either way crafting an efficient word-list is a loveless labour.

For our application we are going to have two types of list, an in-built one and the ability to handle one provided by the user.

Now keep in mind because we haven't done any optimisation in the way of threading for this application make sure you keep your word lists small.

We have included 100 common subdomains in the file below, however, in the future you may want a bigger more complete word list for brute-forcing subdomains, for this we recommend the following resources:

.. literalinclude:: one_hundered_subdomains.txt

.. topic:: Other Word Lists

    * ``dnscan`` (https://github.com/rbsec/dnscan) a Python word list-based sub-domain scanner has a number of lists included including top 100, 500, 1000, 10, 000 as well as a few others

    * ``all.txt`` (https://gist.github.com/jhaddix/86a06c5dc309d08580a018c66354a056) is a GitHub gist that claims to have all word lists from every DNS enumeration tools. It has over 67, 627 lines - **May contain crude and offensive entries**

    * ``SecLists`` (https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) is a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments including a list of common subdomains which can be found under ``Discovery/DNS``.
