Getting Started with PyCharm
=========================================================

The Virtual Machine (VM) you have been provided with includes Python 3.7 pre-installed and ``pipenv`` and PyCharm Community Edition (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

.. note:: My version of this project is called ``bernauer`` so anywhere you see this reference, you can replace it with the name of your project.

Before we start coding you will want to setup your Python project which can be done as follows:

.. image:: _static/imgs/subdomain_enumeration_new_project.png

.. topic:: Step One: Pick the Project Location

   The default location is generally something like ``/Users/username/PyCharm`` however, I generally make two directories a ``/tmp`` one for projects that are in progress and a ``/sauce`` one for where all my completed projects, that I use regularly end up.

.. topic:: Step Two: Select the Environment Basis

   In newer versions of PyCharm you are able to select weather your environment is created using ``virtualenv`` or ``pipenv`` for the basis of our walk-throughs we will be using ``pipenv`` so you become familiar with it. If you accidentally select ``virtualenv`` instead it's no big deal and you can still use ``pipenv`` later.

.. topic:: Step Three: Select the Base Interpreter

   The base interpreter represents the version of Python you will be using. If you're unsure about the location of Python on Mac OS X or Linux you can generally use ``which`` to find the location:

   .. sourcecode:: console

      % which python
      /usr/bin/python

   .. sourcecode:: console

      % which python3
      /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3

   A system independent solution for Python 2 is running:

   .. sourcecode:: console

      % python -c "import sys; print sys.executable"
      /usr/bin/python

   For Python 3 you will need to use a slightly modified version:

   .. sourcecode:: console

      % python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
      /usr/bin/python

   For Windows with PowerShell experience you can run the following to find out where Python is installed:

   .. sourcecode:: powershell

      > cd \
      > ls *ython* -Recurse -Directory

.. topic:: Step Four: Create!

   Once you have configured everything you can create your new project!
