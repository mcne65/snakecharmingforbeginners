=========================================================
Conventions Used in this Document
=========================================================
The following convention guide has been adopted and modified from the O'Reilly series.

We use the following font and format conventions for UNIX commands, utilities, and system calls, please note that all script, configuration files, sample interactive sessions or commands, not mentioned in passing will be contained within a black box.

Excerpts from scripts or configuration files are shown in a constant width font with syntax highlighting:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    #!/bin/sh
    # This script echos "Hello World"
    echo Hello World

UNIX based sample interactive sessions, showing command line input and corresponding output, will be shown in a constant width font, with user-supplied input beginning with a percent sign (``%``):

.. sourcecode:: console

    % cat /etc/named.pid
    78


Windows based sample interactive sessions, showing command line input and corresponding output, will be shown in a constant width font, with user-supplied input beginning with a greater-than sign (``>``):

.. sourcecode:: bat

    > echo There are 41 species of python found within the family Pythonidae
   There are 41 species of python found within the family Pythonidae


For UNIX systems if the command must be typed by the superuser (root), we use the dollar sign (``$``) even if run using the ``sudo`` command:

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ /etc/named
    $ sudo /etc/named

For Windows systems if the command must be called from a terminal with administrative permissions, we will use two greater-than signs (``>>``):

.. sourcecode:: bat

    $ /etc/named
    $ sudo /etc/named

Commands when they appear exactly as a user would type them, are printed in a constant width font, when they appear in the body of a paragraph. For example:

    Run ``ls`` to list the files in a directory.

Filenames are printed in constant width font, for example:

    The BIND name server boot file is usually in ``/etc/named.boot``
