.. epigraph::

   "Please take all your trash with you when you exit."

You enter the little cafe in a daze, the temperature had already hit 30 degrees Celsius and it is only 10 am -- you look around for your tour guide, delayed flights, strange hotels, not to mention your very heavy rucksack. You scan the room, a slight look of worry comes over your face as you check your watch, "Surely, I couldn't be late?!"

"Welcome! Welcome! You look exhausted, please take a seat!" shouts a friendly server, shaking you out of your heat-induced daze. They show you to a table and get you a glass of water and ice, the outside dripping in cool cool condensation. "You wouldn't happen to be here with those adventurers, would you?"

"You... you mean they're `here`?! They haven't left yet?"
