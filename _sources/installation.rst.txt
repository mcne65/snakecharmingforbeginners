When we refer to "Python" in this guide, we will be referring to any version of Python equal to or greater than version Python 3.7. But we will try to be specific.

.. note:: You will **not** be required to install Python on your host operating system (the one installed on your laptop) as you will be provided with a Ubuntu 18.04 Long-Term Support (LTS) "Bionic Beaver" virtual machine provided as an OVA with PyCharm Community Edition. This section has been included for completeness.

.. warning:: The Python Software Foundation plan to continue to provide bug-fix releases for 3.6.x though to at least the end of 2018 and security fixes through 2021.

.. warning:: Python 2.7 will not be maintained past January 1, 2020.

---------------------------------------------------------
Installation on Windows
---------------------------------------------------------

Installation on Windows 7+
=========================================================

If you are running Windows 7+ we are going to install Python via Chocolatey, a community system package manager for
Windows similar to Homebrew on OS X.

The instructions on how to install Chocolatey can be found at https://chocolatey.org/install>.

1. To install the latest version of Python run ``choco install python`` as Chocolatey pushes Python3 as the default
version of Python.

Chocolatey will automatically add Python to your ``PATH`` so you don't need to worry about configuring that. In addition, ``pip``
and ``setuptools`` are both installed by default.

Installation on pre-Windows 7
=========================================================

If you are using a version of Windows prior to Windows 7 you will need to install Python from source, by following the
instructions below:

1. Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version. At the time of writing (14 December 2018) this
was `https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/.
2. To change install location, click on ``Customize installation``, then ``Next`` and enter ``C:\python36`` (or another appropriate location) as the install location.
3. If you didn't check the ``Add Python 3.5 PATH`` option earlier, check ``Add Python to environment variables``. This does the same thing as ``Add Python 3.5 to PATH`` on the first install screen.
4. You can choose to install Launcher for all users or not, either option is fine, as it simply allows you to switch between different versions of Python installed.

If you set the ``PATH`` variable properly, you will be able to run the interpreter from the command line.

5. To open the terminal in Windows, click the start button and click ``Run``. In the dialog box, type ``cmd`` and press ``[ENTER]`` key.
6. Once the terminal is open type ``python`` and you will be dropped into a Python interpreter.

---------------------------------------------------------
Installation on GNU/Linux
---------------------------------------------------------

There is a very good chance your Linux distribution has Python installed, however, in most cases it probably won't be the latest versions, and in many cases it will be Python 2.7 instead of Python 3.x.

.. warning:: If your system comes with Python 2.x.x installed by default do not under any circumstances uninstall this version. In many cases, a lot of packages still depend on these versions of Python and uninstalling it may leave you with a very minimal install of your operating system.

To find out what version(s) you have, open a terminal window and try the following commands:

* ``python --version``
* ``python2 --version``
* ``python3 --version``

One or more of these commands should respond with the version, as shown in the example below:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   % python --version
   Python 2.7.13

If the version is Python 2.x.x or Python 3.x.x is not installed or is not Python 3.7.x at the latest, then you will want to install the latest version. How you do this will depend on the flavour of Linux you are currently using. We will try to summarise the major distributions for you.

Ubuntu
=========================================================

Depending on which version of Ubuntu you are running, the Python installation instructions will vary. You can determine the version of Ubuntu you are running by running the following command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   % lsb_release -a
   No LSB modules are available.
   Distributor ID: Ubuntu
   Description:    Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS
   Release:        16.04
   Codename:       xenial

Ubuntu 17.10/Ubuntu 18.04+
---------------------------------------------------------

Comes with Python 3.7 by default, you can invoke it by opening a terminal window and typing the following:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   % python3

Ubuntu < 17.10/18.04+
---------------------------------------------------------

Does not come with Python 3.7 by default, but is available for download (and installation) via ``apt``. You can install it but opening a terminal window and following the instructions below:

.. topic:: Step One: Download Source Code

   Before starting you will want to download the Python source code, you can do this by visiting https://www.python.org/downloads/source/. For the purposes of this walk through you will want to download the "Latest Python 3 Release" the link for which can be found near the top of the page - this is updated to list the current stable release. At the time of writing this was Python 3.7.1.

   Once you have selected the version you are after, you will notice a **Files** section at the bottom of the page, you want to download the **Gzipped source tarball**. If you prefer using the command line, you can also use ``wget`` to download the current directory:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      % mkdir /usr/src
      % cd /usr/src
      % wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.1/Python-3.7.1.tgz


.. topic:: Step Two: Prepare Your System

   You will first want to make sure your package manager is up to date, on Ubuntu we do this by running the following commands:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get update
      $ sudo apt-get upgrade

   Once this step successfully completes, we will need to make sure we have all the tools and libraries we need to build Python.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall
      $ sudo apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev \
      libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev

.. topic:: Step Three: Build Python

   Once you have successfully installed all the required packages, you can unpack the source into a directory. Without getting too much into Linux directory internals I'd suggest unpacking the directory into ``/usr/local/bin`` the commands you will want to run in a terminal windows is shown in the code block below. However, before we blindly run into that screaming about Pythons and other slithery delights, let's walkthrough what's going on on lines, 3, 4 and 5.

   .. sourcecode:: bash
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5

      % tar xzf Python-3.7.0.tgz --directory /usr/local/bin
      % cd /usr/local/bin/Python-3.7.0
      % ./configure --enable-optimizations --with-ensurepip=install
      % make -j 8
      $ sudo make altinstall
      $ chmod +x python3.7
      % cd ..
      % cd ~


.. topic:: Line 3

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      % ./configure --enable-optimizations --with-ensurepip=install

   The configure script is responsible for getting the software ready to build on your system. It makes sure dependencies are met and ensures the software is installed just the way you want. It's sort of like adding walnuts into the banana bread batter just before you put it in the oven.

   If you are curious to see what a ``configure`` file looks like you can check out the Python one on GitHub https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/configure - there is absolutely no reason you need to do this and frankly this is the authors first time looking at the file as well.

   .. tip:: There are many (like lots) of options available when building Python if you are ever curious about these you can run ``./configure --help``

.. topic:: Line 4

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      % make -j 8

   We then build the Python programs using ``make``. The ``-j`` flag tells ``make`` to split the build into parallel steps to help speed up the time it takes to compile - however, keep in mind that even with parallel builds this can still take a few minutes.

.. topic:: Line 5

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      $ sudo make altinstall

   Then we can install our new version of Python, however, unlike building other programs we use ``altinstall`` instead of ``make install`` this is to ensure we do **not** overwrite the systems version of Python, which on Debian is catastrophic (the author has done this more than once).

   .. warning:: Only use the ``altinstall`` target on ``make``. Using the install target will overwrite the python binary. While it might seem like a good idea to try and upgrade the system version of Python to 3.7.1 there are significant parts of Ubuntu that rely on the pre-installed system version, which cannot be (easily) repaired later!

   You can then invoke Python by opening a terminal window and typing the following:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      % python3.7

Mint
=========================================================

Linux Mint and Ubuntu use the same package management system, you can follow the instructions above for `Ubuntu < 17.10/18.04+`_ .

Debian
=========================================================

Depending on which version of Debian you are running, the Python installation instructions will vary. You can determine the version of Debian you are running by running the following command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   lsb_release -a
   No LSB modules are available.
   Distributor ID:	Debian
   Description:	Debian GNU/Linux 9.5 (stretch)
   Release:	9.5
   Codename:	stretch

Configuring ``sudo``
---------------------------------------------------------

Typically (read: read all the time) ``sudo`` is not installed on Debian, so before we install Python we will want to install ``sudo``.

.. hint:: ``sudo`` is short for "super user do!" and is pronounced like "sue dough".

.. note:: ``sudo`` is considered safer than opening a session as a root user for a number of reasons, these include:

   * Nobody needs to know the root password
   * It's easy to run only the commands that require special privileges via ``sudo``, which reduces the damage that accidentally using the root account can cause
   * When a ``sudo`` command is executed the original username and command are logged

Now even though we just talked about why using ``sudo`` is better than logging into the root account, because our account currently has no permissions we have to log in as root to install ``sudo``. Open a terminal window and typing the following:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ su
   $ apt-get install sudo

Option One: Configure ``sudo`` using ``adduser``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the Debian suggested way. To add an existing user to the ``sudo`` group, open a terminal window and typing the following, remembering to change ``your-username`` to your actual username:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ adduser your-username sudo
   $ exit

Option Two: Configure ``sudo`` using ``visudo``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option will open the ``/etc/sudoers`` file for editing (in a safe fashion). To add yourself to the ``sudoers`` file, you will want to append the following text to the end of the file, remembering to change ``your-username`` to your actual username:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ visudo
   your_username ALL=(ALL) ALL

After being added to a new group you much log out and then log back in for the new group to take effect.

.. hint:: To learn more about ``sudo`` and how to debug common problems see the Debian Sudo page at https://wiki.debian.org/sudo

Installing Python 3.7.1
---------------------------------------------------------

      # For Python 3.7.1
      % wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.1/Python-3.7.1.tgz

.. topic:: Step Two: Prepare Your System

   You will first want to make sure your package manager is up to date, on Debian we do this by runing the following commands:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get update
      $ sudo apt-get upgrade

   Once this step successfully completes, we will need to make sure we have all the tools and libraries we need to build Python.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
      libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev  libncursesw5-dev \

      % make -j 8
      $ sudo make altinstall
      % chmod +x python3.7
      % cd ..
      % cd ~

   You can then invoke Python by opening a terminal window and typing the following:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      % python3.7

---------------------------------------------------------
Installation on OSX
---------------------------------------------------------

Before installing a newer version of Python you will need to install the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). GCC can be installed by downloading and installing Xcode.

.. warning:: If you already have Xcode installed, do not install OSX-GCC-Installer. In combination, the software can cause issues that are difficult to diagnose.

Additionally, if you've been a long time OS X user, you will know while it comes with a number of UNIX like utilities it is missing one key feature - a package manager, so first up if you haven't already, you'll want to install Homebrew.

The instructions on how to install Homebrew can be found at https://brew.sh.

1. To install the latest version of version of Python run ``brew install python3``. At the time of writing (14 December 2018) this was https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371.
2. To verify the installation worked, open a terminal by pressing ``[COMMAND + SPACE]`` keys (or manually open Spotlight search) and type ``Terminal`` and press ``[ENTER]``.
3. Once the terminal is open type ``python3`` and you will be dropped into a Python interpreter.

.. hint:: To install previous versions of Python 3.x.x you will need to visit https://www.python.org/downloads and manually download and install them as Homebrew does not provide other major versions.
